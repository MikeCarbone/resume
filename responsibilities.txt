I collaborate daily with engineering, design, and the accessibility members of our team to create the foundational frontend components and patterns that power our product. The process is fluid depending on the task at hand, but usually it is folded into our various agile meetings and looks like this... first a problem comes to my attention, usually shared from a designer or an engineer on another team. Then the team will examine the problem: Is there a fundamental problem with this-- a bug, an accessibility issue, or poor developer experience? Who is sharing this, and what are their needs? After we understand the problem, it comes time to investigate a solution: are we building something new? Can we use something we already built? Are we saying "no" to the request because it's inaccessible? Before building anything, I'll consult with our accessibility specialist and the design team to get a full picture of what needs to be achieved. After solving the problem, I'll open a pull request, get feedback and approvals from engineering, design and accessibility, then merge the code.
