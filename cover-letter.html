						<span class="company-name">BLANK</span> Team,
					</p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						I am excited to apply for the
						<span class="job-title">BLANK</span> position at
						<span class="company-name">BLANK</span> that I recently
						came across on BuiltInNYC. This job opening stuck out to
						me, and I'd love to share a little bit about myself and
						why I think I'd be a great fit for your team!
					</p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						So much of what I know has been through the development
						of my own projects. While none of those projects led to
						a unicorn exit, each one served as a priceless learning
						experience and exceled my engineering abilities far
						beyond my years of experience. Most of those projects
						required planning and execution of complex backend code,
						including user authentication and management, billing
						infrastructure, database configuration, API structuring,
						as well as core business logic. Then, I'd have to build
						a modern frontend to consume those APIs efficiently,
						while also considering how to provide the best
						user-experience possible.
					</p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						Those side projects have given me more engineering and
						architecture challenges than any formal education or
						workplace. Leading the construction of enterprise-level
						products is no joke, but the learning (and profit) that
						comes from those experiences is priceless. As an
						engineer on the younger side, those endeavors are still
						the most technically impressive pieces of work I've ever
						done, and I continue to raise the bar today.
					</p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						Those skills led me to excel at my first full-time job
						at Newsela, where we built an education-technology
						platform to support teachers and students across the
						country. There, I'd help construct our accessible
						component library and support over 150 engineers—in
						mostly in 1:1 scenarios—accomplish their feature goals
						using the code I architected, specializing in UX and
						accessibility best practices.
					</p>
					<!-- <p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						When co-founding and building Arcade, a design token
						manager for enterprise design systems, we were demoing
						and interfacing with frontend teams at Google, Spotify,
						T-Mobile, Adobe, and more. Those experiences led me to
						my current role where we maintain an extensive component
						library to support over 100 engineers in building our
						product. I believe this experience would be very
						valuable to the NBCUniversal team. If you're curious
						about my experience, here's some insight...
					</p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text"></p>
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						A majority of my engineering skillset was developed
						working on startups, which forced me as an engineer to
						do things a little differently. Time was always the
						company's greatest asset, runway was short and savings
						were burning each day, with an ongoing expectation to
						deliver immediate results. Effective problem-solving was
						paramount as challenge after challenge would stand in
						the way of delivering success. Balancing speed and
						product sufficiency was the key to the game; always
						maintaining that MVP mindset. With all of this in mind
						each day, I learned how to engineer things in a
						different environment than most. I had to be
						resourceful, quick, and effective. Team work would
						literally make the dream work.
					</p> -->
					<p class="copy space-below letter-text">
						<strong
							>That's the skillset I intend to bring to the
							<span class="company-name">BLANK</span>
							team:</strong
						>
						a diverse engineering skillset, focused on delivering
						with the resources I have access to, collaborating with
						the team to ship quality features, and bringing the soft
						skills needed to elevate our team to the next level.
						Together, we will create an excellent product for our
						customers!
					</p>
					<p class="copy letter-text">
						I very much look forward to hearing back from you.
