				<h1>Recommendations</h1>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"I can vouge for Mike Carbone. He has a sharp mind and
						is an ambitious and hardworking engineer who
						consistently delivered top-notch work as a student and
						instructor at Drexel University. Any team would be lucky
						to have him."
					</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"Mike and I worked closely together for two years. In
						that time our team size would fluctuate between two and
						five engineers, but Mike remained a constant I could
						rely on. When on-boarding new engineers I knew I could
						trust Mike to teach them our best practices, or if a big
						crunch time project came up I knew any curve ball I
						tossed his way would be deftly handled. I don't think
						I've worked with any other engineer that can match his
						work ethic and aptitude for picking up new concepts.
					</p>
					<p>
						We managed our company's design system together, and in
						that time we had to adjust numerous designs and call
						signatures resulting in wide-spread breaking changes
						across three different repos. Mike was always thorough
						and quick to fix the breaking changes resulting in zero
						down time for other developers. Mike was also critical
						to our company integrating TypeScript into our codebases
						and has served as a knowledge expert in that area
						helping to bring our other developers up to speed on the
						new language. In his time at Newsela he's also become a
						go-to for build processes and config setups, a skill too
						few engineers develop. When something is broken in a
						weird way Mike is there digging through obscure
						third-party source code to help figure out what went
						wrong.
					</p>
					<p>
						He's incredibly giving with his time and energy, never
						afraid to make the hard decisions or tell hard truths. I
						sincerely hope I get to work with him again in the
						future. If you have the opportunity to work with him you
						should jump at the chance."
					</p>

					<p>
						"It was a pleasure to work with Mike and Carbonology on
						updating and institutionalizing our website. Mike prides
						himself on putting out great work, and he delivered with
						our newly revitalized website. He was easy to work with,
						extremely responsive, and put out an impressive,
						finished product. Every person that has seen our updated
						website has talked about how great it looked, and that
						is credit due to Mike and his team. We look forward to
						working with Mike again in the future."
